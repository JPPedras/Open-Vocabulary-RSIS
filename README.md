# Open Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation

This repository contains the code developed for the thesis with the title "Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training". In particular, it includes the code developed to augment existing remote sensing segmentation datasets, using the encoders from a CLIP model fine-tuned for the remote sensing domain (RemoteCLIP). Also, there is a json file containing the prompt alternatives, such as class plurals and synonyms.
