# Open Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation

This repository contains the code developed for the thesis with title: "Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation from Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-Training". In particular, the code developed to augment existing remote sensing segmentation datasets. Using the encoders from a CLIP model fine-tuned on the remote sensing domain (RemoteCLIP).
